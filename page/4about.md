Testing is developing rapidly. It is a challenge for most companies to support its software systems and improving quality in an efficient way. 

Companies apply more and better Agile and DevOps because they need to generate more flexibility and faster business value.
As a result, there is less space for the tester to carry out its work in a traditional way. All the attention goes to the swift establishment of functionality for the business.

The contribution of the tester is focused more and more on the early issues and automate the functional and non functional test, instead of execution it. This means for testers that they should be more technical. They must be able to read and increasingly write programming languages.

On this GitHub page you will find several tutorial programs that make test automation accessible for anyone who wants to develop themselves in this area.


## About Rick Schuurman

With sixteen years of IT experience I have eleven years experience with software testing in different roles like test engineer, test coordinator and test automation engineer.

Software testing is developing rapidly, the role of testing is changing and I’m sure that the tester of the future is not like’s today tester. Companies apply more Agile / DevOps and development practices like continuous integration / delivery / development. I notice that the roles in an Agile team are blurring, the focus is now on competency.

This is the reason I believe that testers should be able to read bits of code, has knowledge about (test) tooling, write automated test and can debug this. With technical competence a tester is be able to add extra value in a development team and reduce bugs from the very start of the development cycle.

A few years ago my biggest challenge was “ where to start” and I started with reading articles on the internet and follow some courses. Since then I like the challenge to keep in the curve of a rapidly changing software testing environment. And I would like to share this with you !
